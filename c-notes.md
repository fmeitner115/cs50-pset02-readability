Notes: A string in C is defined as a pointer to an array of characters
If you cannot have pointers, by definition you cannot have strings

Notes: A string is an array of bytes terminated in a zero byte - hence the term 'string-zero'.
Without the terminating zero you will not have a string. Instead, you will have an array of characters (bytes) called a buffer.


0 is considered false
1 is considered to be true
However, the exit code for success is 0
any other exit code is considered to be a failure
